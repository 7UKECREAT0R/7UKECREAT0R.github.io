      "WHAT": "MCCompiled is a programming language that, rather than compile to instructions or any sort of IL, compiles to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition function files. Function files are collections of commands that are run sequentially, presenting a unique challenge as a compile target.",
      "WHY": "I work part time as an addons/commands developer for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lbsg.net/\">Lifeboat Network</a>'s marketplace team. Developing large, sustainable projects with complex logic just wasn't possible, so I began this project on the side to help speed up my work. I open sourced it and released it to the Bedrock community. The demand isn't there, but that's fine.",
      "PARADIGM": "Generally, MCCompiled operates as any traditional procedural programming language, similarly to C. Minecraft doesn't inherently have scope or even blocks, so code flow is boiled down to a little more than jumping in and out of subroutines. This was a challenge which was overcome well, but some adjustments need to be learned for one to actually write in MCCompiled effectively; specifically good knowledge about Minecraft's command system."
