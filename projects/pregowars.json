      "THE GAME": "Prego Wars will be a fast paced, character based, first person shooter, deathmach (in that order). It's been a passion project that I've been working with my friends for the past 7 months, bringing tons of new skills to the table.",
      "CHARACTERS": "Featuring the first wave of 8 characters that will be in the game on launch: Zipdip, Plasma, Salty, Luke (me), Onyx, Yucky, Checken, and Fez. They are all actual real life models I put together with PIFuHD and given the most ridiculous abilities and weapons we could think of. More news to come.",
      "STEAM": "The game will be on steam for $5-$10 USD sometime in 2023. It will start with a server located in US-East and we'll expand out if the project is successful."
