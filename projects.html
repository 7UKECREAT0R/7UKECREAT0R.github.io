        <p class="text shadow small">
            The all-purpose discord bot, made to rival and combine a lot of the features of popular bots together into one!
            Me and my original team started this bot as a joke, but it's grown to over 100 servers and tens of thousands of
            users are assisted by it every day! Despite BonziBot's suspicious appearance due to it's inspiration, Bonzi Buddy,
            BonziBot is nothing like the original malware and it's purely a crappy design choice!<br /><br />

            You can check out the bot's page here!:

        <p class="textbold shadow big" style="color: #1e1e1e">TEXTMOD</p>
        <p class="text shadow small" style="color: #1e1e1e">
            Textmod is an extension built for discord. You can run commands and modify your text in ways that normal users can't!
            You can run (for example) "-long Hello World" right in discord and it would send "H e l l o   W o r l d" instead!
            Another cool thing about Textmod is its ability to generate image commands, use free custom emoji, and even allow
            custom rich presence which will spice up your profile! This is my most popular application by far, and version 2.0
            is on its way.
