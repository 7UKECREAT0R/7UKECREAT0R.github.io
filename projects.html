        <p class="text shadow small">
            The all-purpose discord bot, made to rival and combine a lot of the features of popular bots together into one!
            Me and my original team started this bot as a joke, but it's grown to over 100 servers and tens of thousands of
            users are assisted by it every day! The second version is in development right now which aims to fix old issues
			and improve user quality of life! Check it out today and get rid of evil bot clutter and confusing prefixes!<br /><br />

            Join the discord to get the bot and witness my daily experiments:

        <p class="text shadow small" style="color: #1e1e1e">
            Textmod is an extension built for discord. You can run commands and modify your text in ways that normal users can't!
            You can run (for example) "-long Hello World" right in discord and it would send "H e l l o   W o r l d" instead!
            Another cool thing about Textmod is its ability to generate image commands, use free custom emoji, and even allow
            custom rich presence which will spice up your profile! This is my most popular application by far, and version 2.0
            is on its way.<br /><br />

        <p class="textbold shadow big">GALACTIC CLIENT</p>
        <p class="text shadow small">
			The guys at GalacticPvP commissioned this as a random project like 5-6 months ago. I had never made a Minecraft client before, 
			heck a Minecraft mod, so it was a little daunting. After many months of (mostly testing) I finished with it, but it was never
			released because the server was shutting down. It was fun but very challenging to learn something like this from scratch without
			any documentation or guides to go off of, but I would say it turned out pretty good!<br /><br />
			
			This is a video detailing the client, but no download will ever be available (probably):
